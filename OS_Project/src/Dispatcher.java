    The Dispatcher method assigns a process to the CPU. It is also responsible for context switching of
jobs when necessary (more on this later!). For now, the dispatcher will extract parameter data from the
PCB and accordingly set the CPUâ€™s PC, and other registers, before the OS calls the CPU to execute
the job.
